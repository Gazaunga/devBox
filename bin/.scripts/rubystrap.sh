# All Rubies come installed with RubyPick, the Fedora Ruby manager. Therefore CRuby has its executable at /usr/bin/ruby-mri, JRuby has its at /usr/bin/jruby and /usr/bin/ruby is a RubyPick executable that chooses the right version of Ruby to run.

# You donâ€™t need to do anything to set up RubyPick to use CRuby as CRuby is the default. RubyPick was actually introduced to enable Fedora users run other Ruby implementations that might make their way into official Fedora repositories such as JRuby.

# Note that system gems are installed into /usr/share/gems and this path needs to be included in $GEM_PATH in case you are about to modify it.

# To look whether the required gem is available as an RPM package, look at IsItFedoraRuby.com site which tracks the Ruby integration within the Fedora project by listing available information about packaged gems.
